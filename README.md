## Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation (PyTorch) of [(__Multimodal Forgery Detection 
Using Ensemble Learning__)](http://www.apsipa.org/proceedings/2022/APSIPA%202022/ThAM1-6/1570840386.pdf) proposed in APSIPA Paper 2022 (Ammarah Hashmi, Sahibzada Adil Shahzad).

In this paper, we focus on the multimodal forgery detection task and propose a deep forgery detection 
method based on audiovisual ensemble learning. The proposed method consists of four parts, namely a 
Video Network, an Audio Network, an Audiovisual Network, and a Voting Module. 

Given a video, the proposed multimodal and ensemble learning system can identify whether it is fake 
or real.

Experimental results on a recently released multimodal (__FakeAVCeleb dataset__) show that the proposed method achieves 89% accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing models.
